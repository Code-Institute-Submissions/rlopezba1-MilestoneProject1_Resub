- User stories

    1. As a site visitor, I want to see who is going to help me in the company.
    2. As a site visitor, I want to see what they are specialists in.
    3. As a site visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate on the site and get information quickly.
    4. As a site visitor, I want to know how much the consultation will cost me and how to contact them.
    5. As a potential client, I want to make a call, send an email or to know where they are.
    6. As a potential client, I want to know who works there so I know who to contact to.
## Features
- I want the website to be original, elegant, professional, easy to contact, 
    to let me know who are managing the company and where they are, being simple, direct, clear and easy to navigate. 
    It is very important that the user knows in detail the areas of specialization and who the lawyers are,
    and the experience they have, that is why the page allows you to scroll through these pages to acquire
    all the information needed but without overwhelming.
- All pages except the home page will adopt a similar page structure. At the top of each page there will be a 
  fixed response navigation bar that will indicate to 
  the user which page they are currently viewing and will always give them the information
  to contact by phone and receive the marketing message that there is no charge until the case is won, to permanently convey
  the idea of ​​zero risk. The user experience should be easy to navigate and encourage to action. It will contain links
  to other pages on the website and will be sleek black, with the corporate yellow color as in the footer. 
  This navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices and be justified centrally on the page.

- Research has been done on other pages on the internet, but this design, with these colors and fonts,
  is completely original.

- The home page, as the landing page of the site, should contain relaxed content, guide-inspiring, and call-to-action.

### Home
- When they enter the main page and click the button, a Modal opens for them to give us the data, so we do not lose contact
   details. The main page sends messages of calm but invites to action.
    Messages like "Free consultation" or "No fees until we win" or "call Us" will make it easy for potential customers 
    to contact immediatly.
    Contain a large photograph of relaxation and guide, overlaid with the name, the marketing message and the call
    to action button, wrapped in relaxing corporate colors. The button links to a pop-up form, 
    which allows the user to contact or request a quote.
    At the top we find the navigation bar to access the other pages and to contact by phone.

### Our team

- Here you can see the members of the firm, serious and professional images,
    with an explanation of their skills and experience using cards from Bootstrap 4.
    The same navigation bar and a footer with a summary of the mission of the company,
    contact information (email, telephone, address) and links to the social media.
    The footer is responsive to suit each device, keeping the corporate colors.
    It did not appear on the Home page because I wanted to give enough space to the relaxed image and the contact area.

### Practice area

- Show the different specialties of the firm so that the client can clearly see the firm experience.
  The images and texts are adopting the appropriate shape and size for each device, making the information more 
  flexible at all times. Same navigation bar and footer.

### Contact us
- Extensive contact form, with a Google map embedded of the company's location,
    so that the client can see exactly where the company is, and a very apropiate image where we
    can see the lawyer taking a phone call. Same navigation bar and footer to keep the corporate design.
## Skeleleton
- [Wireframe in Design](./assets/documentation/responsive_design.png) 
   using Balsamiq in large, medium and small devices sizes.
- Responsive Design
    - It is important to do a previous wireframe design to structure how the web will be in the future.
        It makes you to structure the information that you want to present in all formats.
        Once the design is done, the coding structure is clearer and more effective. 
        The design is focused on the user and the information that interests them with an elegant design and without too many ornaments.
        I started the wireframe designing for large screens and gradually reduced the size, varying the structure but not the content.
        The content order was important, as less content can be viewed on smaller screens without scrolling. 
        To ensure that users could find key content quickly, some of the content was changed or even removed on smaller screens,
        or added, such as the yellow background on Home page.

## Design

- Colors:
    A palette of three colors to try to give an elegant and relaxed image, where each color complements each other.
    Color palette - Three main colors complement the design of the site. These are shown below: 
    - <span style="color: #ffc107">#ffc107 It's the corporate color for Navbar and footer</span>
    - <span style="color: #343a40; background-color:#ffc107">#343a40 It's also the corporate color for Navbar and footer</span>
    - <span style="color: #e2e2e2">#e2e2e2 It's the background color</span>
    - <span style="color: #007bff">#007bff It's the button color</span>
    - <span style="color: #dc3545">#dc3545 It's the modal button color</span>
    - [Colours](colours.png)

    due to its professional and elegant look.

### Testing Different browsers

### Issues Found
The text on the main page did not look good on some devices. Neither does the yellow border.
- I had to change the format for these devices, especially the font-soze and the yellow border and background
 in "free consultation", as it did not looking good with the rocks in the background large image.
- I had some problems with the modal because the text checker did not work.
 I solved it by introducing the submit button inside the form.
- I had some problems with the footer and navbar in medium size screen. I solved it by changing the margins.

All of these problems have taken me a long time but I have enjoyed solving them.
