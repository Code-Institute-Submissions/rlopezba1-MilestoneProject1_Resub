- User stories

    1. As a site visitor, I want to see who is going to help me in the company.
    2. As a site visitor, I want to see what they are specialists in.
    3. As a site visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the site and get information quickly.
    4. As a site visitor, I want to know how much the consultation will cost me and how to contact them.
    5. As a potential client, I want to leave a call, send an email or know where they are.
    6. As a potential client, I want to know who works so I know who to contact to.
## Features
- I want the site to be original, elegant, professional, easy to contact, 
    to show who are managing the company and where they are, being simple and easy to navigate,
    therefore, the use of sections is very clear, direct and simple. 
    It is very important that the user knows in detail the areas of specialization and who the lawyers are,
    and the experience they have, that is why the page allows you to scroll through these pages to acquire
    all the information that is needed but without overwhelming.
- All pages except the home page will adopt a similar page structure. At the top of each page there will be a 
  fixed response navigation bar that will indicate to 
  the user which page they are currently viewing and will always give them the information
  to contact by phone and receive the marketing message that there is no charge until the case is won, to permanently convey
  the idea of ​​zero risk. The user experience should be easy to navigate the site and encourage action. It will contain links
  to other pages on the website and will be sleek black, with the corporate yellow color as in the footer. 
  This navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices and be justified centrally on the page.

- Research has been done on other pages on the internet, but this design, with these colors and fonts,
  is completely original.

- The home page, as the landing page of the site, should contain relaxed content, guide-inspiring, and call-to-action.

### Home
- When they enter the main page and click the button, a Modal opens for them to give us the data so we do not lose contact
   details. The main page sends messages of calm but invites to action.
    Messages like "Free consultation" or "No fees until we win" or "call Us" will make it easy for potential customers 
    to contact immediatly.
    Contain a large photograph of relaxation and guide, overlaid with the name, the marketing message and the call
    to action button, wrapped in relaxing corporate colors. The button links to a pop-up form, 
    which allows the user to contact or request a quote.
    At the top we find the navigation bar to access the other pages and to contact by phone.

### Our team

- Here you can see the members of the firm, serious and professional images,
    with an explanation of their skills and experience using cards from Bootstrap 4.
    The same navigation bar and a footer with a summary of the mission of the company,
    contact information (email, telephone, address) and links to the social media.
    The footer is responsive to suit each device, keeping the corporate colors.
    It did not appear on the Home page because I wanted to give enough space to the relaxed image and the contact option.

### Practice area

- Show the different specialties of the firm so that the client can clearly see what the firm is an expert in.
  The images and texts are adopting the appropriate shape and size for each device, making the information more 
  flexible at all times. Same navigation bar and footer.

### Contact us
- Extensive contact form, with a Google map embedded of the company's location,
    so that the client can see exactly where the company is, and a very apropiate image where we
    can see the lawyer taking a phone call. Same navigation bar and footer.
## Skeleleton
- [Wireframe in Design](https://github.com/rlopezba1/MilestoneProject1/blob/main/NewProject1.pdf) 
   using Balsamiq in large, medium and small devices sizes.
- Responsive Design
    - It is important to do a previous wireframe design to structure how the web will be in the future.
        It makes you to structure the information that you want to present in all formats.
        Once the design is done, the coding structure is clearer and more effective. 
        The design is focused on the user and the information that interests them with an elegant design and without too many ornaments.
        I started the wireframe designing for large screens and gradually reduced the size, varying the structure but not the content.
        The content order was important, as less content can be viewed on smaller screens without scrolling. 
        To ensure that users could find key content quickly, some of the content was changed or even removed on smaller screens,
        or added, such as the yellow background on Home page.

## Design

- Colors
    A palette of three colors to try to give an elegant and relaxed image, where each color complements each other.
    Color palette - Three main colors complement the design of the site. These are shown below: 
    - <span style="color: #ffc107">#ffc107 It's the corporate color for Navbar and footer</span>
    - <span style="color: #343a40; background-color:#ffc107">#343a40 It's also the corporate color for Navbar and footer</span>
    - <span style="color: #e2e2e2">#e2e2e2 It's the background color</span>
    - <span style="color: #007bff">#007bff It's the button color</span>
    - <span style="color: #dc3545">#dc3545 It's the modal button color</span>

    due to its professional and elegant look.

     with the business easily available to the user.

     where the 3 areas of specialization are specified.

    -   I could easily find it on the Home, through the main button, and through the contact page,
     where there is a form available to use. Alternatively, there are 'email' links all over the site,
      opening my mailbox to write an email if you want, and the same for phone calls.
-   As a potential customer, I want to be able to easily contact someone directly, so that I can arrange to receive a quote.
    -   By visiting the site, it was clear that you could request a quote very easily. I was able to locate a 
    direct phone number, or I was able to send a message using a form. Alternatively, you could send an email directly.

#### Testing Features
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- The navbar was tested to collapse at the correct breakpoint.
- The form and the modal were both tested for validation of inputted data and that the user is forwarded 
to the response page once submitted.
- All buttons and nav links were checked for correct forwarding address.
#### Testing Responsive action
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.


#### Testing Different browsers

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Safari browsers.

### Issues Found
The text on the main page did not look good on some devices. Neither does the yellow margin
- I had to change the format for these devices, especially the font and the yellow background in "free consultation", since it did not look good with the image in the background
I had some problems with the modal because the text checker entered did not work.
- I solved it by introducing the submit button inside the form
I had some problems with the footer and navbar on the size in medium size screen
- I solved it by changing the margins
I had some problems with the cards on the small size screen
- I solved it by changing the margins

All of these problems have taken me a long time but I have enjoyed solving them.
